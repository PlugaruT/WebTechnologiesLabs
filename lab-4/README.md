# Restrict the access

Continue the development of the previous practical assignment and do the following:

### Goals
 - Understand how authentification and authorization works;
 - Get more familiar with MVC pattern;

#### Main requirements:
 - Basic authentification system (basically, the autentificated user can do anything);

#### Bonus points:
 - 2 or more roles are defined and they have different actions defined and each role has well defined permissions; `2pt`

#### Notes:
 - I'm expecting a good report for this one. Write it as best as you can because you have a lot of stuff to talk about.
 - Don't forget to add in your README file how to start the application :)
 - No JS frameworks are allowed.
