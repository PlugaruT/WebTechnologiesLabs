# Do some CRUD

Continue the development of the previous practical assignment and do the following:

### Goals
 - Understand what is an ORM and how to use it;
 - Get more familiar with MVC pattern;
 - Understand BusinessLogic pattern;

#### Main requirements:
 - Define one model;
 - Implement basic Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for the defined model;

#### Bonus points:
 - 2 or more models are defined and there are some relations between them (FK, MtM...); `2pt`
 - Define and `ImageField` or something related in a model. Display the uploaded image in detail view; `1pt`
 - On the list view, implement some basic filtering (search field, etc...); `1pt`

#### Notes:
 - I'm expecting a good report for this one. Write it as best as you can because you have a lot of stuff to talk about.
 - Don't forget to add in your README file how to start the application :)
 - No JS frameworks are allowed.
